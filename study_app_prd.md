# Study App - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
The Study App is a comprehensive learning management solution that empowers users to optimize their academic performance through an integrated multi-panel interface. This document outlines the requirements for developing a web-based study management platform that combines task management, calendar organization, note-taking, and analytics in a unified experience.

## 1. Problem Statement & Opportunity

### 1.2 Target Users
- Primary: University and college students (18-24 years old)
- Secondary: High school students (14-18 years old)
- Tertiary: Adult learners and professional development users

### 1.3 Value Proposition
- All-in-one study management platform
- Seamless integration between different study tools
- Data-driven insights for improved learning outcomes
